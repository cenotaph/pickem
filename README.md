# Pick'em of death

rules
-----

Pick'em Of Death will work on the following concepts:

1. We have a set of potential world currencies in the database. These will not be the home currency of any user.
2. Each week after the football is over, we log into this program and enter what the Yahoo pick'em scores were.
3. Each week, this website randomly picks one of the currencies in the database. Each currency can only be used once per season. We will not know the currency until the week has ended.
4. Each player who did not come in first owes the winner the difference between their score and the person who ranked above them. 1 unit of that currency for every Pick'em point difference in scores.
5. The base currency for the 2013 season will be the Canadian dollar. The ongoing player balances will be kept in that currency.
6. Exchange rates (the weekly currency vs. the Canadian Dollar) will be grabbed automatically from a web API and the rate of the Tuesday following each week's games will be locked into the database for that week.
7. The winner of each week earns the right to name the next week's competition. We prefer offensive and obnoxious names and inside jokes wherever possible.
7. No actual money will be exchanged until the end of the season. This website will keep track of each user's current balance.
8. Players must compete through all 17 weeks of the regular season, but are free to leave the game before the playoffs. They will still owe or be owed whatever their balance is at this point.
9. The money will be exchanged after the Super Bowl, based on the rate of  exchange between the Canadian Dollar and the winner's currency in their country of residence on Super Bowl Sunday.
